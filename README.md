# Stat-302-Project
My parts of a group research project investigating variables affecting student test scores

You can see an html file with the output of my code, and my commentary, at my [html file for Stat-302 project.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MilesMatthews/Stat-302-Project/main/Stat-302-Project-Github.html?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACMC7DGWUE5YBN6VQAPURYJKZMZ4INA)


This repository contains my work for a larger group project conducted for my intermediate statistics class. The project was assigned by my professor Dr. Zeynep Kacar who gave us instructions and guidance on choosing a dataset, doing exploratory analysis, and then carrying out several statistical tests, including checking assumptions for those tests. We conducted this process to answer our research question: how do the factors in the dataset influence studentsâ€™ test scores? The other members of my group were Yasmine Jaffier, Natalie Tsuei, and Kristina He. I included the parts of the project that I completed. I included explanations and commentary throughout the code for my project. 

For the first portion of the project, I performed some exploratory analysis of two-way relationships between variables. I chose to look at the relationship between score and gender and between score and income. You can see the visualizations and transformations I conducted and the conclusions I reached in the project.

For the second portion of the project, I used a multiple linear regression model to explore our research question. After the exploratory phase of our project, we decided that it would be better to look at student test scores instead of their distance from the nearest college. So, I made student scores the response variable for my multiple linear regression model. I used various scatterplots of the residuals to check the assumptions of multiple linear regression. Then I created, refined, and analyzed the multiple linear regression model. You can see the process I went through, including my explanations, commentary, and conclusions, in the code for my project.
